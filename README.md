In this exercise we write a web application using JS, CSS, HTML and React, as well as an Android application.

### Running the application instructions:
- `cd web` (change directory to web).
- `npm start`.
- node: node_modules is in git ignore so before running the code make sure to type in npm install.

To run the tests:
- `npm test`.

### Our work process: 

**Ilanit:** Project management via Jira: adding the tasks and dividing work into subtasks. Designing the layout for the login and registration screens considering options for navigation between them. Added some feed features after the merge. Allowed users to logout, created the design for adding posts and comments and made some general fixes in the code. Writing the tests for the react components and the basic functions.

Ori and I worked together on merging our parts and faced some technical difficulties. Making the components work together and running smoothly after the merge. Added user navigation after implementing correct user authentication logic.

**Ori:** Designing the layout for the feed screen, considering elements such as post previews, user avatars, like/share/comment buttons and functionalities, and a menu for navigation options. Develop functionality to fetch posts from a local JSON file and display them in the feed screen. Ensure smooth scrolling and efficient loading of posts. Supporting light/dark mode.

**Shmuel:** Login and registration components on Android. Design the layout for the login and  registration screen, including input fields for username, email, password, and password confirmation, along with a register and login button Ensure secure storage and handling of user registration data. 

Ilanit and Shmuel had similar parts in different technologies which allowed us to work together as a team and implement similar logic ideas. It allowed us to see the similarities and the differences between the two technologies.
